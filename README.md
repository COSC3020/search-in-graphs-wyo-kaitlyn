# Search in Graphs

Recall the pseudocode for Depth-First Search:

Given a graph, a start node, and a node we're looking for:
- starting at the start node, while unvisited nodes remain
    - if current vertex $v$ is the node we're looking for, return it
    - mark $v$ as visited
    - for each edge $(v,w)$
        - recursively process $w$ unless marked visited

Implement the algorithm. You can choose any of the data structures we covered
(adjacency matrix or adjacency list) for the implementation. Your function
should return the list of nodes on the path from the source to the target (not
the list of nodes that you looked at during the search). Start with the template
I provided in `code.js` and test your new function. I have not provided any test
code, but you can base yours on test code from other exercises.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ complexity of your implementation? Add your
answer, including your reasoning, to this markdown file.

My implementation traverses non-visited nodes until it reaches the target node.  
In the worst case, the target node does not exist, so it will have to travel to each node.
Since it is an adjacency list, the code has to traverse each edge to get to other nodes.  It has to check
each edge to see if it has already been visited.  That means the complexity will be $\Theta(|E| +|V|)$, since 
it will have to visit every node and every edge.

## Bonus

Implement and analyze breadth-first search.
